[WARNING]

This documentation and associated documentation files pertain to the
Public University Demo of Swordlink: Glitchfall Chronicles. These are
subject to change at any time without notice.

== Overview

Swordlink: Glitchfall Chronicles is a 2D stylish action and puzzle game
starring the brilliant programmer, Joel, on a mission to protect his
world from the digital demons that dare threaten it, with his trusty
sword, the Circuit Saber.

Swordlink: Glitchfall Chronicles is built in the Godot Engine, free
software under the GNU General Public License, either version 3 of the
license, or, at your option, any later version.

== Public University Demo

The Public University Demo of Swordlink: Glitchfall Chronicles focuses
mainly on the gameplay mechanics of Swordlink without so much worrying
about graphics or a story or anything too cohesive that you might see in
the full version.

As such, it contains the following copyrighted/trademarked material:

* Sword sound effects from Devil May Cry 3
* Evade sound effect from Sonic the Hedgehog 3
* Menu sound effects from Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)
* Main menu music from Yakuza/Ryu ga Gotoku
* Help menu music from Sonic Adventure 2
* Battle music from Yakuza Kiwami/Ryu ga Gotoku Kiwami
* Enemy sprites from DOOM

These are *placeholders*, and will be replaced with original assets in
the full edition of Swordlink: Glitchfall Chronicles.

The Public University Demo additionally does not include any puzzles,
focusing solely on the combat.

As the Public University Demo includes copyrighted and trademarked
material, it is not legally available to be sold for money, so it's
entirely free for non-commercial use.

== Main Menu

Upon starting the game, the main menu is shown.

image:menu-screenshot.png[image]

From here, you can start a new game, read the help menu, or quit the
game and return to your desktop or home menu.

Use *Up* and *Down* to select an option, and press *Enter* (keyboard),
*A* (controller) or *OK* (touchscreen) to activate the selected option.

== Help Menu

Choose "INFO & CONTROLS" and you'll be taken to the help menu.

image:help-screenshot.png[image]

The help menu is split into six pages - *About*, *Plot*, *Controls*
*List*, *Basic Controls*, *Special Attacks* and *Need More Help?*

Use *Up* and *Down* to flip through the pages.

When you're done reading through the help pages, press *Esc* (keyboard),
*B* (controller) or *BACK* (touchscreen) to return back to the main
menu.

== Difficulty Selection

Choose "NEW GAME" and you'll be shown the difficulty selection popup.
Here, you can choose between four difficulty levels.

image:difficulty-popup.png[image]

The difficulty levels are *Framecapped*, *Boosted*, *Overclocked* and
*Glitchfall*.

Use *Up* and *Down* to select an option, and press *Enter* (keyboard),
*A* (controller) or *OK* (touchscreen) to start the game with the
selected difficulty.

=== Difficulties

* *Framecapped* - Enemy movement and attack speed is slowed down, giving
you ample time to react. Intended for touchscreen players.
* *Boosted* - Enemy movement and attack speed is normal, providing a
balanced challenge. Intended for beginners.
* *Overclocked* - Enemy movement speed is doubled, and they attack much
faster, so you have less time to react. Intended for skilled players.
* *Glitchfall* - Not only do enemies move and attack faster, but you will no
longer regenerate health when defeating enemies. Intended for players who are
REALLY good at not getting hit.

== Gameplay

After choosing a difficulty level, the game will start, and you'll be
thrown straight into the action.

=== Basics

image:gameplay-screenshot-1.png[image]

That young man holding the sword is Joel, your player character. The
large blue bar is your health bar. Let that deplete and it's game over.

Use the *Left* and *Right* to have Joel move around the level.

=== Attacking

When you're up close and personal to the demon heading straight for
Joel, press the *Attack* button to attack. Repeatedly press this button
to perform combos.

You'll notice a few things will happen on-screen next.

=== Style Meter

image:gameplay-screenshot-2.png[image]

You'll see the amount of damage you dealt to the demon as well as how
much health it has left above its head, but you'll also see a strange
white gauge to the right of your health bar.

That bar is your style meter, and it'll fill up the more hits you manage
to dish out. Getting it high enough will let you net higher and higher
ranks, from F to S. But be careful, because waiting around or getting
hit will make it drop.

image:gameplay-screenshot-3.png[image]

In addition to raising your style meter, on difficulty levels other than
Glitchfall, defeating enemies will refill your health, so be mindful of
how much damage you take and how much you dish out. The amount of health
you regain is dependent on your style rank.

=== Evasion

Press the *Evade* button to perform an evasive dash. Hold a movement control
(*Left* or *Right*) before pressing the button to direct your evasion.

image:gameplay-screenshot-4.png[image]

Evading will briefly turn Joel translucent, granting him a small boost
of speed which lets him pass right through enemies - and he can still
attack during this brief invincibility.

Joel can even evade when he's in the middle of being trapped by a bunch
of enemies surrounding him.

=== Jumping & Aerial Combat

Fighting on the ground is all well and good, but Joel can also take
advantage of his technologically-enhanced jumping shoes to leap high
into the air.

Press the *Jump* button to make Joel jump into the air.

image:gameplay-screenshot-5.png[image]

While Joel is in the air, he can still move around and attack just the
same.

Influence your mid-air movement with *Left* and *Right* and press the
*Attack* button to perform an aerial attack, which are the same as
grounded attacks.

It's worth noting here that enemies that are in the air are incapable of
moving or attacking, and will keep their current velocity. You can use
this to your advantage by knocking them away from you with an aerial
attack.

Performing aerial attacks will cause your style meter to fill up twice
as fast, so prioritise attacking your enemies in the air. But how
exactly do you get them _in_ the air...?

=== Special Attacks

There are _two_ ways to perform special attacks: through the Mode-Shift
mechanic or through Easy Input.

To use Mode-Shift, press and hold the *Mode-Shift* button. Mode-Shift
will lock Joel's orientation and slow down his movement. In Mode-Shift,
*Forward* means "press the direction Joel is facing" and *Back* means
"press the opposite direction".

To use Easy Input, press the *Special* key in combination with a
movement direction.

==== Stinger

Stinger is a high-damaging, high-knockback thrusting move which throws
Joel's whole weight behind a powerful forward dash with the Circuit
Saber. This attack will damage a high amount of enemies in front of the
attack and is effective at generating style.

To use Stinger in Mode-Shift, hold *Forward* and press *Attack*.

To use Stinger with Easy Input, simply hold either *Left* or *Right* and
press *Special*. Joel will automatically turn around to face the
direction you perform the attack in.

==== Updraft

Updraft is a low-damage attack which involves Joel swinging the Circuit
Saber upwards, knocking his target upwards. Updraft is mostly designed
to set up aerial attacks, and while it doesn't generate a lot of style
on its own, it can pave the way for a highly stylish aerial combo.

To use Updraft in Mode-Shift, while Joel is on the ground, hold *Back*
and press *Attack*.

To use Updraft with Easy Input, while Joel is on the ground, press the
*Special* button without touching a movement direction.

image:updraft.png[image]

Hold down *Attack* (Mode-Shift) or *Special* (Easy Input) to let Joel
jump up to the target he just knocked into the air, to set up an easy
combo.

image:updraft-jump.png[image]

==== Downslash

Downslash can be considered the opposite of Updraft - it's a very
high-damaging attack that not only sends enemies down, but will send
Joel plummeting into the ground after them, whether or not you hold the
button.

To use Downslash in Mode-Shift, while Joel is in the air, hold *Back*
and press *Attack*.

To use Downslash with Easy Input, while Joel is in the air, press the
*Special* button without touching a movement direction.
