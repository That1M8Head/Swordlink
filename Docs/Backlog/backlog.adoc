= Swordlink: Glitchfall Chronicles Backlog

== Conceptual Stages

In Swordlink's conceptual stages, I took heavy inspiration from the stylish
action game series Devil May Cry. Initially, Swordlink was going to be a silly
non-serious 2D DMC-like named "Guy with a Sword".

I eventually decided I wanted to have something more world-built and grounded
in a proper fantasy world, set in a future where the hubris of man has led to
the world being inhabited by digital demons.

I got this idea from DOOM - a game with a story about the hubris of man leading
to the forces of Hell invading and ransacking Mars, its moons, and eventually
the Earth.

I wanted to have a character that was just a normal guy, but also a programmer,
which fits with the dystopian setting of Swordlink, while also having a
protagonist that the player might be able to relate to.

Eventually I settled on his name, Joel, initially named after no one but
retroactively named after the Vinesauce streamer. Why? Because it's funny,
really. No special reason.

== Pitch Presentation

When it came time to create a pitch presentation for university, this is where
I decided on the core idea for Swordlink - a stylish action hack-and-slash
with programming puzzle elements.

This is also where I decided on the initial idea for the game's plot: a young
man and brilliant programmer, Joel, wielding a tech sword that he built himself,
what would later be named the Circuit Saber, described as the only weapon
capable of fighting against "otherworldly threats", describing the digital
demons in the game's conceptual stages.

One key thing this presentation laid out was that the world would be constantly
flipping between the tangible reality and the digital realm, and this is what
would allow these demons in to the physical world.

The presentation also detailed the gameplay features of the game, namely the 2D
hack-and-slash gameplay, with a style meter, combos, air combos, launching
attacks, double jumping, wall jumping and similar mechanics inspired by the
Devil May Cry games.

Interestingly, the presentation detailed the style ranks D to S, however in
the game itself, the ranks range from F to S. The game also detailed mechanics
that are not present in the game, such as double jumping, wall jumping, parrying
and taunting.

== Initial Development

=== Stage Design

At the beginning of the development process, I had to decide on the initial
design for the game's only level. I decided to take inspiration from the stylish
action FPS game ULTRAKILL - specifically, the Cyber Grind endless arena game
mode.

image:ultrakill-cyber-grind.png[ULTRAKILL Cyber Grind]

The main inspiration taken from the Cyber Grind is the grid-like aesthetic
and relatively simple level design -- perfect for a simple gameplay demo
that focuses more on combat than impressive level design.

(Screenshot from commit "Initial commit",
6aa29472fcd5385ade2305edb786c44e74ababbb, which is not indicative of the initial
level design.)

While basic and unrefined, this initial level design would suit the gameplay
of Swordlink's Public University Demo, which focuses entirely on combat
elements, not so much on intricate level design.

=== Character Design

For a character sprite, I was going to spend countless hours designing and
refining pixel art for Swordlink's protagonist, Joel, but ultimately decided
it would take too much time, and settled on a much simpler image with no
animations, the Circuit Saber being separate from Joel himself, so that I
could animate it in Godot Engine using rotations rather than drawing Joel
holding the sword as one sprite, for each frame.

image:joel.png[Joel]  image:joelsword.png[Circuit Saber]

I based Joel's design off a young man, with spiked brown hair, a purple shirt,
blue jeans and Sonic the Hedgehog-inspired shoes.

I based the design of the Circuit Saber on a sort of combination between a
broadsword and a baseball bat, with a red light on the back which was meant
to be a sword of indicator for the sword's power.

If I were given more time to work on these sprites, I would have taken
heavy inspiration from the Devil May Cry series, perhaps a sort of blend between
the characters Dante and Vergil, and I would have taken inspiration from the
indie platformer Pizza Tower for exaggerated animations and graphics.

=== Character Movement

The character movement of Joel grew incrementally, starting out with the
basic Godot Engine CharacterBody2D script, and then gradually adding more
features like jumping, evading, attacking, aerial momentum, and the Mode-Shift
mechanic.

A key part of making the movement in Swordlink work was making sure Joel's
momentum was preserved while also allowing him to control his direction both
on the ground and in the air, allowing for high-speed movement with max control.

In addition to this, the Mode-Shift mechanic, to make it less challenging to
land attacks where you want them to land, will slow Joel down and inhibit his
momentum entirely.

=== HUD Design

The first thing I did when designing the HUD was create a simple health bar and
a rank with an associated description. This rank would eventually become the
style meter.

There was no proper implementation yet - the health bar had no functions to
update concurrently with Joel's actual health (since it didn't exist yet) and
there was no scripting at all for the style meter, so it just remained at F.

The style meter would be highly inspired by the system in Devil May Cry 3,
where attacking enemies would fill up the meter, waiting or getting hit would
make the meter drop, if the meter filled it would raise your rank, and if the
meter emptied it would lower your rank.

The HUD went through several iterations before settling on a final design -
the health bar used tweening to animate the health bar, and the style meter
used a simple growing animation when gaining a new rank.

image:current-hud.png[Current HUD]

The health bar was given a slanted blue appearance with a light blue background,
and the style meter was given a more rounded appearance with an outline, being
placed underneath the style rank.

=== Menu Design

The menu was the part of Swordlink I probably spent the least amount of time
on. While I still worked on it a lot, it wasn't nearly as much as how much
time I put into working on the other parts of the game.

I decided not to reinvent the wheel, opting for a simple text-based menu
using the Godot Engine's Label nodes for menu items.

image:menu.png[Menu]

This is where I came up with the idea of making this edition of Swordlink the
"Public University Demo", since it was the first public demo created entirely
for this university project.

I decided not to make this too extravagant for the sake of simplicity, so I
could actually put my limited time towards the parts of the game that actually
mattered.

The "NEW GAME" option originally started the game straight away without a
further prompt, but I decided later to add a difficulty menu that the user could
choose to back out of if they wanted to.

image:difficulty-menu.png[Difficulty Menu]

The "INFO & CONTROLS" option was the main menu option that originally brought
up the help screen, detailing what Swordlink was and what controls were
available. This was later extended to a full help menu.

image:help.png[Help Menu]

The "QUIT TO <OS name>" option initially quit the game immediately, but I
quickly decided I wanted to have a DOOM-style quit prompt, with randomised
funny messages to almost try and dissuade the player from quitting, even
opting for the old DOS game-style Y to quit and N to go back.
